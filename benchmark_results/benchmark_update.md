# Benchmark Update Summary

## May 2024 Update: Multiple System Comparison

### What's New

This update adds implementation and benchmarking for multiple RAG systems to provide a comprehensive comparison against AdaptiveContext:

1. Successfully implemented and benchmarked:
   - LangChain adapter with Chroma vector store
   - Activeloop DeepMemory adapter with DeepLake vector store

2. Implemented but requires additional dependency work:
   - LlamaIndex adapter
   - Qdrant adapter

### Key Findings

Our benchmark results using the llama3.2 model revealed distinctive strengths among the systems:

1. **LangChain** excels at:
   - Retrieval precision (0.410) 
   - Overall retrieval quality (F1 score: 0.375)
   - Fast query response times (4.84s average)

2. **Activeloop DeepMemory** excels at:
   - Complex query handling (score: 0.670)
   - Multi-hop queries (score: 0.513)
   - Relationship handling (score: 0.761)
   - Some knowledge retention capability (0.150)
   - Highest recall (0.448)
   - Primary drawback: Significantly slower query times (44.21s average)

3. **AdaptiveContext** excels at:
   - Memory efficiency (0.750)
   - Moderate performance in other areas
   - Areas for improvement: Retrieval precision and speed

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Activeloop DeepMemory**:
   - Fixed API compatibility issues with DeepLake
   - Updated to use langchain_community.vectorstores.DeepLake
   - Implemented proper document handling with unique IDs
   - Successfully resolved search functionality issues

2. **Qdrant Adapter**:
   - Fixed import issues for langchain_community
   - Added proper error handling for initialization and search
   - Added fallback mechanisms for when Qdrant isn't available

### Future Work

1. **Dependency fixes**:
   - Resolve remaining issues with LlamaIndex integration
   - Complete Qdrant benchmarking

2. **Performance improvements**:
   - Enhance AdaptiveContext retrieval precision
   - Optimize query response times
   - Improve knowledge retention capabilities

3. **Extended evaluations**:
   - Test with more powerful models
   - Add specialized benchmark datasets
   - Develop visual comparisons of results

### Branch Status

This branch contains all the benchmark adapter implementations and results, and should be maintained separately from main until all implementations are fully tested and documented.
