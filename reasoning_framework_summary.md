# CortexFlow Reasoning Framework Implementation

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. ReasoningEngine Class
- **Purpose**: Coordinates inference processes and multi-step reasoning
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-step reasoning orchestration
  - Integration with existing inference engine
  - State tracking for reasoning processes
  - Multiple reasoning strategies

### 2. Query Planner
- **Purpose**: Breaks complex questions into reasoning steps
- **Key Features**:
  - Query type detection (causal, comparison, temporal)
  - Step planning based on query type
  - Entity and relation extraction for reasoning

### 3. ReasoningState
- **Purpose**: Tracks state during multi-step reasoning
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintains history of reasoning steps
  - Tracks entities discovered during reasoning
  - Captures confidence scores for each step

### 4. Path-based Inference
- **Purpose**: Enhanced graph traversal for knowledge exploration
- **Components**:
  - **BidirectionalSearch**: Efficient path finding from both directions
  - **ConstrainedPathSearch**: Path traversal with relation filtering
  - **WeightedPathSearch**: Paths considering relationship confidence
  - **PathExplanation**: Human-readable explanations for paths

### 5. Agent Chain Integration
- **Purpose**: Leverage reasoning capabilities in the agent workflow
- **Enhancements**:
  - Explorer agent uses bidirectional search for discovery
  - Analyzer agent uses weighted paths for analysis
  - Synthesizer agent incorporates reasoning steps in responses

## Usage Examples

### Basic Reasoning
```python
from cortexflow.config import CortexFlowConfig
from cortexflow.knowledge import KnowledgeStore
from cortexflow.reasoning_engine import register_reasoning_engine

# Setup
config = CortexFlowConfig()
knowledge_store = KnowledgeStore(config)
register_reasoning_engine(knowledge_store, config)

# Use reasoning engine
result = knowledge_store.reasoning_engine.reason("How is Python connected to mathematics?")
print(result["answer"])
```

### Path-based Inference
```python
from cortexflow.path_inference import register_path_inference

# Register path inference capabilities
register_path_inference(knowledge_store.graph_store)

# Use bidirectional search
paths = knowledge_store.graph_store.bidirectional_search(
    start_entity="Python",
    end_entity="Mathematics",
    max_hops=3
)

# Generate human-readable explanation
explanation = knowledge_store.graph_store.explain_path(paths[0])
print(explanation)
```

### Agent Chain Integration
```python
from cortexflow.agent_chain import AgentChainManager

# Create agent chain
agent_chain = AgentChainManager(config, knowledge_store)

# Process query with reasoning capabilities
result = agent_chain.process_query("How does Python relate to artificial intelligence?")
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each component is designed to be independent but integrable
2. **Extensible Strategies**: Different reasoning strategies can be plugged into the framework
3. **Confidence Tracking**: All reasoning steps track confidence for better result evaluation
4. **Enhanced Path Finding**: Multiple path-finding algorithms for different use cases
5. **Human-readable Explanations**: Path explanations to make reasoning transparent

## Next Steps

1. Add more specialized reasoning strategies for different domain types
2. Improve the reasoning steps with more advanced inference techniques
3. Enhance the explanation generation for better interpretability
4. Add visualization capability for reasoning paths
5. Implement additional metrics for evaluating reasoning quality
