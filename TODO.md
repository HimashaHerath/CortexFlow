# AdaptiveContext - Chain of Agents Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements for the Chain of Agents framework in AdaptiveContext.

## Core Implementation Status

✅ Base Agent class with required interfaces  
✅ Three specialized agents (Explorer, Analyzer, Synthesizer)  
✅ AgentChainManager for coordinating sequential agent processing  
✅ Integration with CortexFlowManager  
✅ Configuration options in CortexFlowConfig  
✅ Testing with coa_test.py  

## Planned Enhancements

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Increase timeout thresholds for complex queries (currently 30s per agent)
- [ ] Implement caching for intermediate results to avoid redundant processing
- [ ] Optimize prompts for faster processing with larger models (llama3, etc.)
- [ ] Add streaming response option for real-time feedback

### UI Integration

- [ ] Create visualization component to show reasoning process of each agent
- [ ] Add debugging UI to inspect agent reasoning steps
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for long-running agent processes
- [ ] Develop web interface for interactive exploration of agent chain

### Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Add support for parallel agent processing where applicable
- [ ] Implement dynamic agent selection based on query complexity
- [ ] Develop feedback mechanisms between agents
- [ ] Create mechanism for agent recursion (agents can call themselves)

### Additional Agent Types

- [ ] CriticAgent for evaluating and improving answers
- [ ] PlannerAgent for breaking down complex tasks
- [ ] FactCheckerAgent for verifying factual accuracy
- [ ] SpecialistAgents for domain-specific reasoning

### Resilience

- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery for agent failures
- [ ] Implement fallback strategies when agents timeout
- [ ] Add graceful degradation when specific agents fail
- [ ] Build monitoring and logging for agent performance

### Integration

- [ ] Closer integration with GraphRAG for knowledge-intensive queries
- [ ] Support for external tool usage by agents
- [ ] API endpoints for programmatic access to agent capabilities
- [ ] Batch processing mode for offline analysis

### Model Optimization

- [ ] Evaluate and optimize for different models (llama3, mixtral, etc.)
- [ ] Add model-specific prompt templates
- [ ] Implement model quantization options for faster inference
- [ ] Create benchmarks for comparing agent performance with different models
