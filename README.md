# AdaptiveContext

A memory optimization system for local LLMs running via Ollama that implements a multi-tier memory architecture inspired by human cognition and recent AI research (TITANS and TransformerÂ²).

## Overview

AdaptiveContext dynamically manages context information, retaining important elements while discarding less relevant ones to maximize effective context window utilization without increasing memory requirements. The system uses a multi-tier memory approach:

- **Active Tier**: Holds the most recent and important context
- **Working Tier**: Medium-term storage with moderate compression
- **Archive Tier**: Long-term storage with higher compression
- **Knowledge Store**: Persistent storage for important facts beyond the conversation

## Features

- Multi-tier memory management optimizes token usage
- Importance-based information retention using rule-based, ML, and LLM classification
- Progressive context compression with extractive and abstractive summarization
- Knowledge store for long-term information persistence
- **Dynamic memory tier weighting** for adaptive token allocation based on query complexity and content type
- **Vector-based knowledge retrieval** for semantic search of stored knowledge
- **Advanced retrieval techniques**:
  - **Hybrid search** combining vector similarity with BM25 keyword scoring
  - **Sparse-dense fusion** merging results from different retrieval methods
  - **Re-ranking** for improved retrieval precision
  - **GraphRAG** using knowledge graphs for complex multi-hop queries
  - **Chain of Agents** for collaborative multi-agent reasoning over complex queries
  - **Self-Reflection** for verifying knowledge relevance and response consistency
- Compatible with all Ollama models (tested with Llama, Mistral, Phi, Gemma variants)
- Task-aware adaptation for different conversation types
- Surprise-based retention prioritizes unexpected or important information
- Time-based decay gradually deprioritizes older information

## Core Components

### Memory Manager

Orchestrates context flow between the three memory tiers, managing token limits and tier transitions. The manager intelligently moves context segments based on importance scores, age, and tier fullness, ensuring essential information remains accessible while less important content is compressed or archived.

### Importance Classifier

Determines which information is worth retaining using three classification methods:
1. **Rule-based**: Uses patterns and heuristics to identify important content
2. **ML-based**: Uses lightweight features for fast classification (simplified implementation)
3. **LLM-based**: Uses the Ollama model itself for high-precision classification

### Context Compressor

Reduces token count while preserving semantic meaning using multiple compression strategies:
1. **Truncation**: Simple truncation for code blocks and very short content
2. **Extractive**: Keyword-based sentence extraction for medium-importance content
3. **Abstractive**: LLM-based summarization for high-importance content

### Knowledge Store

Persists important facts and retrievable context beyond the immediate conversation:
1. Stores structured fact triples (subject-predicate-object)
2. Maintains conversation summaries with keyword indexing
3. Supports explicit "remember" commands
4. Implements time-based forgetting for outdated information
5. **Uses vector embeddings** for semantic search and retrieval
6. **Advanced retrieval techniques**:
   - **Hybrid search**: Combines dense vector similarity with sparse BM25 keyword scoring
   - **Result fusion**: Merges results from different retrieval methods with normalized scores
   - **Re-ranking**: Applies a secondary scoring pass to refine retrieval precision
   - **GraphRAG**: Builds and queries a knowledge graph for complex multi-hop queries

### Graph Store

Manages a knowledge graph for complex relational queries:
1. Extracts entities and relationships from text using NER and dependency parsing
2. Builds a graph database with entities as nodes and relationships as edges
3. Enables complex multi-hop queries across documents
4. Provides path finding between entities to answer complex questions
5. Integrates with the knowledge store for comprehensive information retrieval

### Chain of Agents Framework

Enables collaborative multi-agent reasoning over complex queries:
1. Explorer Agent searches broadly for relevant information
2. Analyzer Agent examines relationships between facts
3. Synthesizer Agent generates comprehensive answers
4. Sequential processing allows for complex reasoning chains
5. Specialized prompt templates guide each agent's focus

Each agent in the chain serves a specific role:
- **Explorer Agent**: Concentrates on broad exploration without answering the query directly, retrieving diverse relevant knowledge using both vector and graph-based approaches
- **Analyzer Agent**: Identifies relationships between discovered facts, finding connections and patterns relevant to the query
- **Synthesizer Agent**: Combines insights from previous agents to generate a comprehensive final answer that integrates all discovered information

This multi-agent approach follows research from Google's "Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long Context Tasks" (2025) and is particularly effective for:
- Complex queries requiring multi-hop reasoning
- Questions that benefit from structured exploration before answering
- Queries where connecting multiple pieces of information is necessary

To use the Chain of Agents framework:
```python
# Enable Chain of Agents in your configuration
config = AdaptiveContextConfig(
    use_chain_of_agents=True,
    chain_complexity_threshold=5,  # Only use for reasonably complex queries
    # ... other config options
)

# Create the manager with this configuration
manager = AdaptiveContextManager(config)

# Regular usage - CoA is automatically engaged for complex queries
manager.add_message("user", "What connection exists between X and Y?")
response = manager.generate_response()
```

### Self-Reflection and Self-Correction

Implements verification and correction mechanisms to improve response accuracy:
1. **Knowledge Relevance Verification**: Evaluates retrieved knowledge items for relevance to the query
2. **Response Consistency Checking**: Analyzes responses for factual inconsistencies with the knowledge base
3. **Automated Response Revision**: Revises responses when inconsistencies are detected
4. **Confidence Calibration**: Expresses appropriate uncertainty when knowledge is limited or contradictory

The Self-Reflection mechanism is particularly effective for:
- Handling contradictory information in the knowledge base
- Preventing hallucinations and unsupported claims
- Ensuring factual accuracy in responses
- Resolving ambiguities in retrieved knowledge

To use the Self-Reflection functionality:
```python
# Enable Self-Reflection in your configuration
config = AdaptiveContextConfig(
    use_self_reflection=True,
    reflection_relevance_threshold=0.6,  # Minimum score for knowledge relevance
    reflection_confidence_threshold=0.7,  # Minimum confidence for consistency
    # ... other config options
)

# Create the manager with this configuration
manager = AdaptiveContextManager(config)

# Regular usage - Self-Reflection is automatically applied
manager.add_message("user", "What is X?")
response = manager.generate_response()  # Response is verified and corrected if needed
```

For more details on Self-Reflection, see [docs/self_reflection.md](docs/self_reflection.md).

### Dynamic Memory Tier Weighting

Implements adaptive token allocation between memory tiers based on conversation characteristics:
1. **Query Complexity Analysis**: Evaluates the complexity of user queries using linguistic features
2. **Document Type Detection**: Identifies the type of content in the conversation (code, text, data, mixed)
3. **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Monitors query complexity patterns over time
4. **Adaptive Token Allocation**: Dynamically adjusts token limits for each memory tier

The Dynamic Weighting mechanism is particularly effective for:
- Optimizing token usage across different conversation types
- Adapting to changing complexity levels during a conversation
- Providing more memory resources to tiers that need them most
- Automatically adjusting to user interaction patterns

To use the Dynamic Weighting functionality:
```python
# Enable Dynamic Weighting in your configuration
config = AdaptiveContextConfig(
    use_dynamic_weighting=True,
    dynamic_weighting_learning_rate=0.1,  # Learning rate for weight adjustments
    dynamic_weighting_min_tier_size=1000,  # Minimum token size for any tier
    # ... other config options
)

# Create the manager with this configuration
manager = AdaptiveContextManager(config)

# Regular usage - Dynamic Weighting is automatically applied
manager.add_message("user", "What is X?")
response = manager.generate_response()  # Memory tiers are dynamically adjusted

# Get statistics about dynamic weighting
stats = manager.get_dynamic_weighting_stats()
print(stats)

# Reset to default weights if needed
manager.reset_dynamic_weighting()
```

For more details on Dynamic Weighting, see [docs/dynamic_weighting.md](docs/dynamic_weighting.md).

    # Memory tier settings
    active_tier_tokens=4096,     # Maximum tokens in active memory tier
    working_tier_tokens=8192,    # Maximum tokens in working memory tier
    archive_tier_tokens=16384,   # Maximum tokens in archive memory tier
    
    # Importance thresholds
    working_importance_threshold=0.3,  # Minimum importance for working tier
    archive_importance_threshold=0.1,  # Minimum importance for archive tier
    
    # Token counting method
    token_counting_method="basic",  # "basic", "tiktoken", "ollama"
    
    # Memory compression
    enable_compression=True,      # Whether to enable compression

    # Ollama settings
    ollama_host="http://localhost:11434",
    default_model="gemma3:1b",    # Default Ollama model to use
    
    # Persistence paths
    storage_path="~/.adaptive_context",  # Base storage path
    knowledge_store_path="~/.adaptive_context/knowledge.db",  # Knowledge DB path
    
    # Retrieval settings
    use_vector_embeddings=True,   # Whether to use vector embeddings
    use_reranking=True,           # Whether to use result re-ranking
    
    # GraphRAG configuration
    use_graph_rag=True,           # Whether to use knowledge graph for retrieval
    graph_weight=0.3,             # Weight for graph-based results in ranking
    enable_multi_hop_queries=True,  # Enable complex multi-hop queries
    max_graph_hops=3,             # Maximum path length for graph traversal
    
    # Chain of Agents settings
    use_chain_of_agents=True,      # Enable Chain of Agents framework
    chain_complexity_threshold=5,  # Minimum query complexity for CoA
    chain_agent_count=3,           # Number of agents in the chain
    
    # Self-Reflection settings
    use_self_reflection=True,      # Enable Self-Reflection functionality
    reflection_relevance_threshold=0.6,  # Minimum score for knowledge relevance
    reflection_confidence_threshold=0.7,  # Minimum confidence for consistency
    
    # Dynamic Weighting settings
    use_dynamic_weighting=True,    # Enable Dynamic Memory Tier Weighting
    dynamic_weighting_learning_rate=0.1,  # Learning rate for weight adjustments
    dynamic_weighting_min_tier_size=1000,  # Minimum token size for any tier
    dynamic_weighting_default_ratios={     # Default tier ratios
        "active": 0.25,
        "working": 0.35,
        "archive": 0.40
    }
)
```

## How It Works

1. When new messages are added, they're classified for importance (0-1 scale)
2. Messages are added to the active tier initially
3. As tiers fill up, less important and older messages are moved to lower tiers
4. Messages moved to lower tiers undergo progressive compression
5. Very important facts are extracted to the knowledge store for permanent retention
6. When relevant, knowledge is retrieved using advanced hybrid search techniques and added to the context
7. For complex queries, GraphRAG builds and traverses a knowledge graph to find relationships between entities
8. Memory tier token limits are dynamically adjusted based on query complexity and content type

This approach optimizes token usage while maintaining contextual understanding across long conversations.

## GraphRAG Architecture

The GraphRAG system combines traditional retrieval-augmented generation with knowledge graph capabilities:

1. **Entity Extraction**: Identifies entities in text using SpaCy NER, noun phrase extraction, and proper noun detection
2. **Relation Extraction**: Extracts relationships between entities using dependency parsing
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Builds a graph database using SQLite and NetworkX
4. **Graph Queries**:
   - Entity-based retrieval: Finds facts about specific entities
   - Path queries: Finds connections between entities
   - Subgraph extraction: Builds knowledge subgraphs for complex queries
5. **Integration with Vector Retrieval**: Combines graph-based and vector-based retrieval results

The GraphRAG approach is particularly effective for:
- Questions about relationships between entities
- Multi-hop reasoning (e.g., "What connects X and Y?")
- Complex queries that traditional vector retrieval struggles with
