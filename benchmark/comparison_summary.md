# AdaptiveContext Benchmark Comparison Summary

We've implemented a comprehensive benchmarking framework that allows comparison of AdaptiveContext with other popular RAG systems:

## Implemented System Adapters

1. **AdaptiveContext Adapter** (Original)
   - Implements multi-tiered memory architecture
   - Utilizes GraphRAG for complex query handling
   - Supports dynamic memory weighting

2. **LlamaIndex Adapter** (New)
   - Implements retrieval using VectorStoreIndex
   - Uses Ollama models for generation
   - Maintains conversation history with ChatMemoryBuffer

3. **LangChain Adapter** (New)
   - Implements conversation retrieval chain
   - Uses ConversationalRetrievalChain for RAG functionality
   - Works with Chroma vector store for embedding-based retrieval

4. **Activeloop DeepMemory Adapter** (New)
   - Uses DeepLake for vector storage
   - Implements conversation memory with ConversationSummaryMemory
   - Maintains vector embeddings for retrieval

5. **Qdrant Adapter** (New)
   - Implements Qdrant vector database for retrieval
   - Uses QdrantRetriever for similarity search
   - Maintains conversation context with chat memory

## Benchmark Metrics

The benchmark evaluates all systems across three main dimensions:

1. **Retrieval Quality**
   - Precision, Recall, and F1 scores
   - Response time for queries

2. **Memory Efficiency** 
   - Token usage efficiency
   - Knowledge retention after conversation
   - Memory flush handling

3. **Query Complexity**
   - Multi-hop question handling
   - Relationship query performance
   - Complex reasoning score

## Initial Results

The initial benchmarks on AdaptiveContext showed:
- Strong memory efficiency (0.75 score)
- Good knowledge graph utilization for complex queries (0.28 complex query score)
- Relatively low precision/recall in initial tests, likely due to Ollama model configuration issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete the installation of all dependencies to ensure all adapters work properly
2. Run comprehensive benchmarks with the llama3.2 model across all systems
3. Generate visualizations comparing performance across systems
4. Optimize AdaptiveContext based on benchmark findings, particularly in retrieval quality

## Running the Comparison

To run the full comparison benchmark:

```bash
cd benchmark
./run_comparison.sh
```

This will install necessary dependencies, check for the required Ollama model, and run the benchmark across all implemented system adapters.

Results will be saved to the `benchmark_results` directory with visualization charts and a detailed summary report.
