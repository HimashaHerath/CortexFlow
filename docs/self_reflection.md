# Self-Reflection and Self-Correction

## Overview

The Self-Reflection and Self-Correction mechanism in AdaptiveContext enables the system to verify the relevance of retrieved knowledge, check for inconsistencies in generated responses, and revise answers based on detected issues. This feature was implemented based on research showing that adding a verification step after knowledge retrieval significantly improves the quality and accuracy of AI responses.

## Key Features

1. **Knowledge Relevance Verification**
   - Evaluates the relevance of retrieved knowledge items to the user's query
   - Filters out irrelevant information before it's included in the context
   - Assigns relevance scores between 0.0 and 1.0 to each knowledge item

2. **Response Consistency Checking**
   - Analyzes generated responses for factual inconsistencies with the knowledge base
   - Identifies unsupported claims not present in the knowledge base
   - Detects logical contradictions within the response
   - Flags potential hallucinations or made-up information

3. **Automated Response Revision**
   - Regenerates responses when inconsistencies are detected
   - Maintains the helpful tone of the original response
   - Ensures factual accuracy based on the knowledge base
   - Removes unsupported claims and hallucinations

## How It Works

The Self-Reflection process follows these steps:

1. **Knowledge Retrieval Phase**:
   - When a user query is received, the system retrieves relevant knowledge items
   - The ReflectionEngine.verify_knowledge_relevance() method evaluates each item's relevance
   - Items below the configured relevance threshold are filtered out

2. **Response Generation Phase**:
   - The system generates a response using the filtered knowledge
   - The ReflectionEngine.check_response_consistency() method analyzes the response
   - If consistency issues are detected, the response is flagged for revision

3. **Response Revision Phase**:
   - If the response is inconsistent, ReflectionEngine.revise_response() is called
   - A revised response is generated, addressing the specific issues
   - The revised response replaces the original one before being sent to the user

## Configuration

Self-Reflection can be enabled and configured in the AdaptiveContextConfig:

```python
config = AdaptiveContextConfig(
    # Enable Self-Reflection
    use_self_reflection=True,
    
    # Minimum relevance score for knowledge items (0.0-1.0)
    reflection_relevance_threshold=0.6,
    
    # Minimum confidence for consistency checks (0.0-1.0)
    reflection_confidence_threshold=0.7
)
```

## Integration Points

The Self-Reflection functionality is integrated with the core AdaptiveContext system at two key points:

1. In `AdaptiveContextManager.get_conversation_context()`, where knowledge relevance verification is applied
2. In `AdaptiveContextManager.generate_response()`, where response consistency checking and revision are applied

## Example Usage

Here's how to use Self-Reflection with AdaptiveContext:

```python
from adaptive_context import AdaptiveContextManager, AdaptiveContextConfig

# Create a configuration with Self-Reflection enabled
config = AdaptiveContextConfig(
    use_self_reflection=True,
    reflection_relevance_threshold=0.6,
    reflection_confidence_threshold=0.7
)

# Initialize AdaptiveContextManager with this configuration
context_manager = AdaptiveContextManager(config)

# Add some knowledge that includes contradictions
context_manager.remember_knowledge("The Eiffel Tower is 330 meters tall.")
context_manager.remember_knowledge("The Eiffel Tower is 300 meters tall.")

# When a query is processed, Self-Reflection will automatically:
# 1. Filter out irrelevant knowledge
# 2. Check response consistency
# 3. Revise the response if needed
context_manager.add_message("user", "How tall is the Eiffel Tower?")
response = context_manager.generate_response()
print(response)  # Will provide a consistent, accurate response
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Response Accuracy**: By verifying knowledge relevance and checking response consistency, the system produces more accurate answers.

2. **Contradiction Resolution**: When contradictory information exists in the knowledge base, the system can identify and resolve these conflicts.

3. **Hallucination Prevention**: The system can detect and correct hallucinations before they reach the user.

4. **Confidence Calibration**: The system can express appropriate uncertainty when knowledge is limited or contradictory.

## Implementation Notes

The Self-Reflection functionality requires a capable language model to perform the verification and revision tasks. It's recommended to use a model with at least 7B parameters for effective evaluation of relevance and consistency.

Each reflection phase adds some latency to the response generation process. The latency impact can be controlled by adjusting the relevance and confidence thresholds based on the use case requirements.
